# Profitable App Profiles on App Store and Google Play
by Nicholas Archambault

This project aims to understand which types of free apps are most likely to attract and maintain users based on genre popularity within both the App Store and the Google Play store. Analysis is limited to free apps since they provide a truer picture of the motivating factors responsible for popularity beyond up-front purchase revenue.

The validation strategy for an app idea is comprised of the following steps:

- Build a minimal Android version of the app; add it to Google Play

- Develop further if the app receives positive response from users

- If the app is profitable, create iOS version of the app and add it to App Store

## Goals
1. Clean and analyze datasets from both Apple and Google
2. Remove non-English apps and isolate free apps
3. Determine the most popular genres of free apps on App Store and Google Play

## Output
A recommendation for the specific genre and type of free app best suited for profitable deployment across both platforms.
